#  Serial Killer Quiz

## Description
I don't know that this will really solve any problems but it sure is fun? I made a Serial Killer Quiz. We were tasked with making a functioning quiz that can save your score within local storage. I definitely learned a lot about using event listeners and of course about local storage. 
## Usage
You can use this to learn a little something about serial killers.
